# Changelog

### Para quem fará a correção do arquivo:

- Bem vindo, sinta-se a vontade para explorar o resto do repositório!
- Ainda estou me acostumando com vercionamento, convenções e nomenclatura, mas acredito que este foi uma boa primeira tentativa
- **Não** me pergunte o que aconteceu com o branch da aula 5, digamos que a distração ao alterar a forma de vercionamento levou ao pulo de alguns passos

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
